//When a member of a class is declared as protected, that  member is not accessible by other

//is the same as access to a private  memberâ€”it can be accessed only by other members of its class.
//The sole exception to  this is when a protected member is inherited
//If the base class is inherited as public, then  the base class' protected members become
//protected members of the derived class and are, therefore, accessible by the derived class
